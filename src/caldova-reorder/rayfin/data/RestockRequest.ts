// No database policy on either action, deliberately.
//
// `create` cannot carry one: an INSERT has no WHERE clause for Data API Builder
// to attach a policy to, so declaring one fails every write.
//
// `read` could, but the policy would have to match on `claims.sub`, and the
// Fabric-brokered session token does not carry that claim — Data API Builder
// applies read rules to the row a mutation returns, so an unevaluable policy
// breaks the write too.
//
// Neither is a gap. Reorders are only ever written by the `sendReorder`
// function, which takes the requester from the signed-in identity rather than
// from the caller, so a reorder cannot be attributed to somebody else. And what
// a manager *sees* is scoped by the semantic model's own `RegionalManager`
// row-level security, which is where that rule belongs.
