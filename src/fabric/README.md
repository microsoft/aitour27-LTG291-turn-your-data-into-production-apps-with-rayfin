# Caldova semantic model

The Fabric semantic model behind the LTG291 demo. It is where Caldova's numbers are *defined* — the app, the regional dashboard and any analytics all read the same definitions from here, which is why their numbers cannot disagree.

## What is in here

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `caldova-operations.SemanticModel/` | The model definition, in TMDL (required for Direct Lake) |
| `dax/` | Queries used to smoke-test the deployment, and handy to run on stage |

The model reads four Delta tables in the lakehouse, loaded from `data/generated/`:

| Model table | Delta table |
| --- | --- |
| `Stores` | `stores` |
| `Products` | `products` |
| `Inventory` | `inventory` |
| `Sales` | `sales` |

`RestockRequests` is different: it is not seeded. The app in [`../caldova-reorder/`](../caldova-reorder/) writes reorders into its own Fabric SQL database, which Fabric mirrors into OneLake as Delta, and the model reads that copy with Direct Lake. A reorder a manager sends therefore lands in the model without a refresh or a copy step, which is what makes the dashboard number move on stage.

## The definitions that matter

Every measure lives in the model, not in application code. Change one here and every consumer changes with it, with no redeploy.

| Measure | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `Latest Sales Date` | The most recent day the sales data covers. The model's own notion of "now". |
| `Avg Daily Demand` | Units sold per day over the trailing 28 days, for this product in this store. |
| `Days of Stock` | On-hand units divided by average daily demand. The number the low-stock queue is ranked by. |
| `Low Stock Threshold Days` | **7.** Caldova's definition of "running low". |
| `Is Low Stock` | Whether this product in this store is below that threshold. |
| `Stock Status` | `Critical`, `Low` or `Healthy` — urgency as a word, so it does not depend on colour. |
| `Products Running Low` | How many product-store combinations are running low. |
| `Stores Under Pressure` | How many stores have at least one product running low. |
| `Suggested Reorder Units` | The quantity to pre-fill on a reorder, to restore `Target Cover Days` plus safety stock. |
| `Avg Daily Sales` | Units per day over whatever window the caller filters to. Over 28 days it reproduces `Avg Daily Demand` exactly. |
| `Estimated Stock` | Stock as it stood on a past day, worked back from today's count by adding sales since. |
| `Estimated Days of Stock` | The same, expressed as days of cover. |
| `Estimated Products Running Low` | How many product-store pairs were running low on a past day — the trend behind the app's headline tile. |
| `Reorders Sent Today` | Requests made today, in UTC. Reads zero before the first reorder of the day. |
| `Open Restock Requests` | Requests sent to purchasing but not yet fulfilled. |

The three `Estimated …` measures exist because `inventory` is a **snapshot**: it carries no
history, so a stock trend has to be reconstructed rather than read. They add sales back on to
today's count, which assumes no deliveries arrived during the window — fine for judging a week's
movement on a product that is running low, and not a stock ledger. Each measure says so in its
own description, and the app repeats it wherever the numbers are shown.

Demand is anchored on `Latest Sales Date` rather than `TODAY()` on purpose. The generated sales window is fixed, so by demo day it is already in the past; anchoring keeps `Days of Stock` meaningful whenever the model is queried. `Reorders Sent Today` is the deliberate exception — it uses the real current date, so the tile reads `0` at the start of the demo and moves the moment a live reorder lands.

## Row-level security

The model defines a `RegionalManager` role that scopes `Stores` to the regions the signed-in user manages, matched on `manager_upn` against `USERPRINCIPALNAME()`. This is where "a manager sees only their own region" belongs — in the model, not in the app.

The role ships **unassigned**, so it has no effect until someone is added to it. To try it:

```
fabio semantic-model add-role-member --workspace <workspace> --id <model> --role RegionalManager --member <upn>
```

Assign it only to a test identity that exists in `stores.csv`. A user who manages no store will see an empty model.

## Deploying

Use `deploy.sh` (macOS, Linux) or `deploy.ps1` (Windows) from the repository root. Both do the same thing: load the CSVs into Delta tables, bind this model to the lakehouse and to the app's SQL database, deploy it, refresh it to frame Direct Lake, and smoke-test it.

Deploy the Rayfin app **first**, because the model binds to its SQL database:

```bash
cd src/caldova-reorder && npx rayfin up      # creates the app and its SQL database
fabio item list --workspace <workspace> --all # find the caldova-reorder SQLDatabase + SQLEndpoint ids
```

Put those two ids in `.env` as `RAYFIN_SQL_DATABASE_ID` and `RAYFIN_SQL_ENDPOINT_ID`, then:

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # then fill it in
./deploy.sh --dry-run    # check everything locally first
./deploy.sh
```

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
./deploy.ps1 -DryRun
./deploy.ps1
```

The scripts require an existing workspace and never create or delete one. They also never sign you in — authenticate fabio yourself first and they will check with `fabio auth status`.

### Storage mode

`FABRIC_MODEL_STORAGE_MODE` in `.env` decides how the model reads the lakehouse:

- `onelake` (default) — Direct Lake straight onto the OneLake Delta files. Recommended, and keeps the SQL analytics endpoint off the critical path.
- `sql` — Direct Lake through the SQL analytics endpoint. The fallback if the OneLake binding misbehaves.

`definition/model.tmdl` carries a `{{DATABASE_QUERY_SOURCE}}` placeholder that the deploy script fills in with the right source for the chosen mode. The committed definition is therefore not directly deployable by hand — deploy through the script.

## Running the queries by hand

```
fabio semantic-model query --workspace <workspace> --id <model> --file src/fabric/dax/low-stock-queue.dax
```

- `smoke-test.dax` — one row proving every measure family answers. Run by the deploy script.
- `low-stock-queue.dax` — the worst-first list a regional manager acts on.
- `headline-tiles.dax` — the header tiles, plus the anchor date and threshold behind them.
- `recent-restock-requests.dax` — the governed reorder record, newest first.

## Resetting

```bash
./deploy.sh --reset
```

Deletes the named semantic model and lakehouse, and nothing else. The workspace is always left in place.
